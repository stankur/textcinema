I need help to create a diagram in the LLM + Algorithms for Natural Language Analytics page.

I want the hexagon that looks similar as the hexagon lattice that has been created for filtering and ordering animations.

Now I want to create the diagram, and title for a new section, enriching. 

This is a bit different, I want the dots in the hexagonal lattice to be "split" into more smaller dots, but still be arranged regularly. I'll leave this up to you how you want to do it, but it must still look like a regular hexagonal lattice, just with more dots, and smaller.

And I want the "enriched" hexagonal lattice which is just the more granular lattice with smaller and larger quantity of dots, to be the thumbnail.
